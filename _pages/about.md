Hello! I am Yujian Liu, a third-year Ph.D. student in computer science at UCSB. I am advised by [Prof. Shiyu Chang](https://code-terminator.github.io). I also work closely with [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/yang-zhang/). My research focus is on machine learning and natural language processing.

I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan, where I was advised by [Prof. Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/index.html) and [Prof. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/index.html).

Previously, I interned at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab with Dr. Yang Zhang, and Adobe Research working primarily with Dr. Tong Yu.
